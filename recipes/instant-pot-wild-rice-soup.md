# Instant Pot Creamy Mushroom Wild Rice Soup

Wild Rice Soup in the Instant Pot! So creamy and simple and ready in an hour. Perfect for fall/winter nights!

Yield: 6 servings (1 1/2 cups per serving)

Prep Time: 15 mins
Cook Time: 45 mins
Total Time: 1 hour

#### Ingredients

For the Instant Pot:

* 5 medium carrots, chopped
* 5 stalks celery, chopped
* half of an onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 cup uncooked wild rice (see notes)
* 8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
* 4 cups vegetable or chicken broth
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning (see notes)
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

For the Stovetop:

* 6 tablespoons butter
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1 1/2 cups milk (I used 2%)

#### Directions

Instant Pot:

1. Put all the ingredients in the first list into the Instant Pot. Cook for 45 minutes (manual, high pressure). Release steam using the valve on top.

Stovetop:

1. When the soup is done, melt the butter in a saucepan. Whisk in the flour. Let the mixture cook for a minute or two to remove the floury taste. Whisk the milk, a little bit at a time, until you have a smooth, thickened sauce. Throw a little salt in there for good measure.

Together:

2. Mix the creamy sauce with the soup in the instant pot. Voila! Mushroom Wild Rice Soup.

Notes

1. Cook Time: If you’re short on time, 30 minutes should do the trick as well!

2. Please use actual wild rice! I know it’s on the expensive side, and hard to find, and I’m normally all about the substitutions, but in this case, it is not&nbsp;the same. Don’t use brown rice, don’t use white rice, and don’t use a “wild rice blend” which is just white or brown rice with a few flecks of wild rice. Use straight WILD RICE. Chicken can be added – just pop it in the instant pot with everything else and shred it when it’s done. Poultry seasoning is usually a mix of thyme, sage, garlic, onion, etc. I used a “chicken grilling spice” in one of my test batches and it tasted great. Anything with those earthy spices – thyme, sage, maybe even rosemary – will work nicely. Crockpot version: Check out this recipe. Stovetop version: Saute carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and mushrooms with oil. Add wild rice, broth, and salt. Simmer until wild rice is cooked (1-2 hours). Make the roux and mix it in.
