# Pork Potstickers


Better-than-takeout potstickers you can make right at home! With a tender, flavorful pork filling with garlic, ginger and green onions!

#### Ingredients

* 1 pound ground pork
* 1 1/4 cups green onions, thinly sliced
* 1/3 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
* 1 tablespoon reduced sodium soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
* 2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce, or more, to taste
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 32 (3-inch) round wonton wrappers
* 2 tablespoons canola oil
* 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds

#### Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine ground pork, green onions, cilantro, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, chili garlic sauce and sesame oil.

2. To assemble the potstickers, place wrappers on a work surface. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture into the center of each wrapper. Using your finger, rub the edges of the wrappers with water. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, pinching the edges to seal.

3. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add potstickers in a single layer and cook until beginning to crisp on the bottom, about 2-3 minutes. Working quickly, add 1/4 cup water; cover and cook until liquid has evaporated and bottoms of dumplings are crisp and golden, about 3-5 minutes.
4. Serve immediately, garnished with sesame seeds, if desired.

Notes:

* The filling in the potstickers does not have to be cooked prior to wrapping.
* To freeze, place uncooked potstickers in a single layer on a baking sheet overnight. Transfer to freezer bags.
